\chapter{Project Plan}
\label{ch:project_plan}
In the following section, the project plan of the proposed master's thesis is discussed.
The project plan consists of a work plan, time schedule, and risk assessment.
The work plan defines the project objectives, milestones, tasks, and deliverables and is presented in \autoref{sec:work_plan}.
The time schedule represents the mapping of the proposed work plan to calendar weeks and is discussed in \autoref{sec:time_schedule}.
The risk assessment evaluates technical and non-technical risks for the proposed project plan and is discussed in \autoref{sec:risk_assessment}.

\section{Risk Assessment}
\label{sec:risk_assessment}
The risk assessment identifies technical as well as project management risks and assesses their impact on the proposed project plan.\dots
\todo{Find, analyse, describe, estimate risks}
\todo{Provide mitigation ideas for each risk}
