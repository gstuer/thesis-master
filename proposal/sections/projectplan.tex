\chapter{Project Plan}
\label{ch:project_plan}
In the following section, the project plan of the proposed master's thesis is discussed.
The project plan consists of a work plan, time schedule, and risk assessment.
The work plan defines the project objectives, milestones, tasks, and deliverables and is presented in \autoref{sec:work_plan}.
The time schedule represents the mapping of the proposed work plan to calendar weeks and is discussed in \autoref{sec:time_schedule}.
The risk assessment evaluates technical and non-technical risks for the proposed project plan and is discussed in \autoref{sec:risk_assessment}.

\section{Work Plan}
\label{sec:work_plan}
%\todo{Workplan, Incremental Parts ("inkremente"), Dependencies, Deliverable-Duration-Limitation, time schedule (milestones, temporal dependencies)}
The work plan structures the proposed thesis into six milestones.
Each milestone represents a major phase of the proposed master's thesis.
The milestones serve as intermediate project goals which enable monitoring and reporting of project progress.
Each milestone is defined by its duration in calendar weeks (CW), deliverables, and tasks.
Each milestone consists of at least one task.
A task of a milestone is referred to as increment.
The duration of a milestone depends on the duration of its increments and increment interdependencies.
The projected timescales for the completion of milestones and increments have been calculated based on empirical values.
The milestones of the proposed master's thesis are defined as follows:

\section{Time Schedule}
\label{sec:time_schedule}
The time schedule maps the milestones and increments as defined in \autoref{sec:work_plan} to specific calendar weeks.
The mapping of the proposed master's thesis is shown in \autoref{fig:timeplan}.
The proposed time schedule covers the period from the 30th calendar week of 2024 to the 4th calendar week of 2025.
In other words, the time schedule spans from July 22nd, 2024 to January 20th, 2025.
The work plan stipulates that the approach presented in this thesis proposal has to be realized and evaluated within the 26-week period.
Additionally, the remaining chapters must be completed and the written elaboration of the thesis must be finalized within this timeframe.

The visualized time schedule shown in \autoref{fig:timeplan} illustrates the milestones II to VI.
The initial milestone represents the preliminary work and has therefore been excluded from the visual representation.
Multiple increments mapped to the same calendar weeks may be performed in parallel, as there are either no interdependencies or existing dependencies can be resolved beforehand.
Accordingly, the indicated duration of an increment takes the occurrence of parallelization into account.
In regard to the realization of CASA and SABAAC, the dependency inversion principle and service interfaces are employed to resolve existing dependencies.
Other increments such as the different areas of the evaluation do not have interdependencies.
The realization, evaluation, and conclusion milestones depend on the results of their predecessors.
Consequently, the preceding milestones must be completed before the next milestone can commence.
The finalization milestone is only partially dependent on the review milestone due to its binding increment.
Accordingly, independent increments of these milestones can be performed simultaneously.
