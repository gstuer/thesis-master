\chapter{Approach}
\label{ch:approach}
In the following section, we introduce our proposed security approach for substation automation systems.
With the aim of securing the time-critical communication between resource-constrained devices in a time-variable environment, we propose a security framework for \textbf{S}erver-aided \textbf{A}BAC with \textbf{Z}ero-RTT \textbf{E}ncryption (SAZE).
The SAZE ("Sassy") security framework is able to prevent and mitigate cyberattacks by providing security mechanisms and enforcing mandatory communication policies.

The introduction and discussion of the proposed approach is organized as follows.
At the beginning of this chapter in \autoref{sec:approach:system_model}, we discuss the field of application of the proposed approach by introducing a system model and defining its requirements.
Based on the presented system model and requirements, we introduce the security model and architecture of the SAZE security framework in \autoref{sec:approach:security_model}.
The two main SAZE concepts server-aided ABAC and zero-RTT encryption are introduced in \autoref{sec:approach:sa} and \autoref{sec:approach:ze}.
In \autoref{sec:approach:realization} we present the planned realization of the SAZE security framework.
Subsequently, we present the proposed evaluation strategies and metrics of the security framework in \autoref{sec:approach:evaluation}.
Finally, in \autoref{sec:approach:limitations} we discuss limitations of the proposed approach.

\section{System Model}
\label{sec:approach:system_model}
In the following sections, we introduce the system model of the SAZE approach.
The system model serves the purpose of delimiting the scope and area of application of the proposed approach.

The area of application of the proposed approach is the power system domain.
More specifically, the proposed approach is tailored to the communication and control systems of substations in the electricity grid.
The communication and control equipment of an ICS is referred to as secondary equipment.
The entirety of secondary equipment of a substation is referred to as Substation Automation System (SAS) \cite{Padilla2015}.
Although the proposed approach is tailored to the power system domain and substation environment, its main concepts may also be applied to other ICS with similar requirements and constraints.

\subsection{Architecture}
The architecture of the presented system model and SAS respectively is based on the IEC 61850 standard \cite{IEC61850P5}.
The presented system model architecture consists of four layers called network level, station level, bay level, and process level.
The process, bay, and station level represent the internal layers of a SAS architecture.
The SAS architecture containing the process, bay, and station level as well as the station and process bus further discussed in \autoref{sec:approach:system_model:communication} is shown in \autoref{fig:substation_architecture}.
The network level represents a SAS-external layer to integrate multiple SAS instances into a comprehensive power system.
Each of the four layers consists of different devices and provides different control and automation functions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Process Level: The process level provides functions to interact with the physical process via sensors and actuators.
    As a consequence, SAS devices located at the process level provide interfaces to the physical process.
    In other words, devices located at the process level transform analog measurement signals or control signals into digital values and vice versa.
    Devices restricted to the transformation and provision of measurement and control values are referred to as Merging Units (MU).
    Moreover, IEDs can be employed to combine MU functions with higher-level functions such as protection or communication tasks.

    \item Bay Level: The bay level provides common functions of so-called bays of a SAS.
    As stated by the \citeauthor{IEC61850P5} \cite{IEC61850P5}, a bay represents a closely connected subpart of a substation with common functionality.
    The devices at bay level supervise the operation of lower-level devices of a SAS bay.
    Consequently, a supervising bay level device is referred to as bay controller or bay protection.

    \item Station Level: The station level provides functions related to the substation as a whole.
    Therefore, the station level comprises devices required for on-site and remote monitoring and control of the substation.
    Devices at the station level include Human Machine Interfaces (HMI) for substation operators as well as Wide Area Network (WAN) gateways like SCADA RTUs.

    \item Network Level: The network level provides higher-level functions exceeding the scope of a single SAS.
    The network level devices include supervisory monitoring and control devices like SCADA MTUs.

\subsection{Communication}
\label{sec:approach:system_model:communication}
In the following, we discuss the communication between devices of the presented system model.
For this purpose, we firstly identify different communication characteristics based on which communication relationships and messages can be classified.
Secondly, we define three messages types for time-critical ICS and SAS communication.
Lastly, we discuss the bus-based device interactions occurring in the above-mentioned four layer system model.

\subsubsection{Classification Characteristics}
The communication relationships between devices can be classified using different communication characteristics.
Topological communication characteristics can be used to classify the device relationships based on their relative or absolute location within the system model.
Accordingly, communication can either occur between devices on the same layer or different layers of the system model.
Communication on the same layer of the system model is referred to as horizontal communication, whereas communication between devices on different layers is referred to as vertical communication.
Moreover, communication can occur between devices of the same or different subsystems.
Communication between devices of the same subsystem is classified as (subsystem) internal communication, whereas communication relationships including an external device are classified as (subsystem) external communication.

Besides the topology-based classification, communication relationships can be classified based on their continuity.
Continuous, session-oriented, or stateful communication requires an initial session establishment between the involved devices.
While the first message exchange requires additional initialization overhead, subsequent latencies might benefit from the established communication session.
Discontinuous, message-oriented, or stateless communication enables communication without initial overhead for the involved devices.
Consequently, discontinuous communication does not lead to latency emerging from session initialization and management.

Since communication in ICS and SAS is time-critical, communication relationships can be classified based on their communication latency requirements.
